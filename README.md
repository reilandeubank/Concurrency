# Concurrency

C Code from Project 3 in CS300 - Operating Systems at the University of Alabama.
This code simulates the way concurrent producer and consumer processes interact by having each server serve exactly 1 customer. Concurrency is achieved through the use of simple mutex locks and semaphores.
